# FingerInTheAir
Android application to read temperatures from 1-wire bus devices attached to USB via a serial adapter.

Uses OneWire from https://github.com/cdot/OneWire and UsbSerial from https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial

The app is built using Android Studio. A pre-built dist/OneWire.jar file can be downloaded from https://github.com/cdot/OneWire/blob/master/dist/OneWire.jar, or you can clone the OneWire project and build your own using NetBeans. Put the jar file in app/libs.
